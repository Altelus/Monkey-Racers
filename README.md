# Monkey-Racers

Monkey Racers	is a game designed by Gamesmiths where you play as Dexter the monkey, a Monkey on a tropical island enjoying himself when suddenly the volcano on the island erupts. Dexter must now escape from the island to the dock before time runs out while avoiding the eruptions of the volcano!	

**Objective**  
Get from the beginning of the level to the end of the level with the highest score possible. Find the most optimal route to get the most points!

**Scoring**  
For each coconut collected in the level, a 1000 points is added to your total. At the end of the level, every one second  remaining adds a score of 500 points to your Total. If you die by either fall off into the water or a meteor lands on  you, you restart at the beginning of the level with a 5000 point reduction to your score.
